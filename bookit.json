Located just 11km north of Greymouth, this quiet, secluded location immediately on the beachfront offers a range of facilities and activities for your comfort and relaxation – all while being central to a range of popular West Coast tourist attractions. Favourite pastimes for visitors include swimming in the “school pool” or on the beach, gemstone hunting, fishing, observing the local seal colony at Point Elizabeth, checking out the amazing geological papa rock and limestone features on the rugged northern point, or whitebait fishing on the river nearby. Maybe you would just like to simply read a book from our library or teach the kids a few of the old school board games? There’s something for everyone. ​ Motorhome and caravan sites (powered or non-powered), tent sites, and cabins available.",

We saw a need to provide accommodation for all the visitors being turned away from our 'Cool Little Town' by a lack of accommodation. The family tradition of generous hospitality then evolved into Hokitika Holiday Park. Our family owned and operated business was designed by experienced campers with the aim to solve some of the difficulties and frustrations often encountered while holiday-making. For this reason, our sites are generous, our facilities strategically situated, and parking any vehicle is easy. We are passionate about our holiday park, not only for your enjoyment, but because it is an investment for our children and their future. You may see our children on site, and they will be excited and pleased to see you too. We're here to help you have a great time in the place we love.",

We moved onto this property in 2007 with the idea of providing quality accommodation to people that liked to get 'away from the crowds'. We renovated the house, built the chalets and developed the walkways through the wetland and up through the native bush. We derive our income from the accommodation and meals we provide, leasing out the pasture part of the property, beekeeping (Producing honey from the manuka that is so abundant in the area) and accumulation of carbon credits from the covenant / carbon farm part of the property. We are both passionate about the environment and the opportunity to protect this part of the Mangarakau swamp was too good to pass by. We decided to combine our experience in Motelling with our passion for the Wetland and offer top quality accommodation with good friendly service while also keeping our impact on the environment to an absolute minimum. The flowers, fruit, berries, vegetables and trees in the garden are now quite stunning and provide a lot of the organic fresh vegetables and fruit that we serve with our meals. We have now formed a QE2 covenant covering all the swamp and buffer area part of the property and fenced the stock out of this and all the drains and streams leading into it. We have also defined the same area as a carbon farm and collect the carbon credits from it each year.",

All our accommodation and amenities are in repurposed and upcycled shipping containers... Its amazing how much comfort you can fit into a small space. We sit right next to the Tasman sea and most nights you can drift off to sleep listening to the sound of the ocean breaking on the shoreline. .... Blissfully relaxed amongst our natural landscape of NZ Flax.\n\nWe have11 quirky units available or as we like to call them Apartment Pods or Sleeping Pods. Our upcycled shipping container pod accommodations are a real treat, we offer peaceful relaxation from each pod; sit out on your deck surrounded by private, native gardens. Each container has been individually designed and all offer a great night’s sleep. The Apartment Pods are fully self-contained, whilst the remaining pods have full access to the communal amenities of camp kitchen, ablution block, and guest laundry. Along with the accommodation we also offer spacious, level, powered and un-powered sites gravel sites and a couple of smaller areas of grass for those who travel with small tents. If camping is more your thing, or you want to pop the kids in the tent whilst you Glamp it up in the Pod, you can bring your gear for an un-powered night under the canvas.

Belongings can be stored in our secure storage available on request. \n\nLate check-out is subject to availability, must be pre-arranged and may incur additional charges. \n\nIf you wish to extend your stay, please contact Haka House with as much notice as possible, extensions are subject to availability and may result in a room move.\n\nIf you wish to shorten your stay this must be done within at least 24 hours’ notice of your new check-out date. \n\nAny delays in vacating the bed/room after 1000 NZT will result in an additional fee on top of the room rate.\n\n5.

The named guest is responsible for the visitor while onsite and liable for any damages and room fees that the visitor incurs.\n\nAll non-guest visitors must leave the property before 8 pm. \n\nAll non-guest visitors must only use the common areas and not private rooms or dorms. \n\nYOUR STAY\n1. SMOKING\nSmoking is not permitted inside any part of the Haka House Buildings; this includes the use of vapes. There are designated areas for smokers outside the building. Any guest who smokes inside the room is liable to pay a cleaning fee. In addition, any guest suspected of or caught altering smoke detectors or sprinklers will be asked to leave the property immediately without a refund.\n\n2. FIRE ALARM CHARGES\nOur fire alarms are automatically connected to the fire service.

Between 2200 NZT and 0800 NZT, we request that you respect all other guests and keep the noise level to a minimum. Should we receive any noise complaints this will be considered a first warning, and if repeated, we reserve the right to charge a NZ$30 disturbance fee per person and ask you to leave the premises quietly.\n\n5.

    "description": "Affordable accommodation on Banks Peninsula, 30mins to Akaroa. The Gateway to Banks Peninsula we offer much more than a holiday park. Our campground is rated highly by bookit customers and on line reviews like Trip Advisor and camping apps . Please read on so you know what to expect.\n\nA classic Kiwi campground in the peaceful Okuti Valley, 45mins from Christchurch. Camping like it use to be. Rustic cabins, powered and tent sites for camper vans, caravans and secluded tent sites. Eco, dry composting toilets, with 3 hot showers ($2 for 4mins). Free Wifi hotspot (conditions apply- no games or downloads). Sunny or shady sites and on arrival choose the most suitable available. Over busy times sites can be very snug. Patience is asked for over busy periods, as our facilities are limited. The experience is more about the native habitat than the luxuries of some holiday park chain. They don't usually have giant swings or rivers and native bush reserve! The camp is perfect for kids to get back to nature, play on the in-ground trampoline or have a kick around. Our covered kitchen area for campers has a fridge/freezer, toaster, jug, gas hobs and microwave. 3 sinks with hot and cold water for dishes. Fees from $15/adult, $10 kids under 14- and from $75 for a cabin. Ideal for a group and can be cheaper than a dorm room at a backpackers. Unique 7.5h park like, riverside setting with native forest walks and picturesque views. Ideal for 'off the beaten track' explorers wanting to find the real NZ. Local knowledge on the best beaches, surf and activities. From $15/adult. There are powered sites for camper-vans, cabins and camp areas. Back to Nature camping.",

Whether you are looking for a place to accommodate your whole family, individual or are on a romantic gateway, we have got you covered. Sai Group of Motels is a firm that has put together several types of motels, hotels, inns, lodges into one place to help improve their services and offer more to customers. In our hands, everything will be taken care of to ensure you get the best services in every facility in our catalog. The facilities are in different areas to enable us to cover a wider area while providing the best. At first many of the facility owner’s didn’t like our approach but after a series of meetings and discussions, we were able to get them on board. Under our banner, every facility undergoes a series of inspection to ensure the services are the best. We start by checking the cleanness level, checking the food, customer support and most importantly are the facilities secure. The latter is essential since no one would like to stay in an unsecured place. At first, the inspection is done without your knowledge. After the first inspection, our team will offer you feedback on ways to improve your facility to reach the best level. Please note we are still accepting applications for facilities that want to join Sai Group of Motels.",

Home away from home!\n\nManowhenua Lodge, formally known as Ski Haus was purchased in the Winter of 2019 by born and bred locals -Thomas & Tracey. With local knowledge and expertise, Thomas and Tracey embarked on a new journey recognising the lodge's potential. With aspirations to show the lodge some much needed TLC and to bring the once beautiful accommodation back to its former glory, renovations began - including a new name. Wanting a new start for the lodge that respects its original heritage, a te ao Maori perspective was needed. As tangata whenua, Thomas and Tracey wanted to incorporate korero around what the lodge meant to them. This resulted in consultation, guidance and aroha being sought... Manowhenua was then introduced. The Meaning of Manowhenua The heart and center of National Park. For those who come to stay at our home (the Lodge) will have a belonging, and we become one people.

Depending on the room rate selected, payment may be due at the time the reservation is made through our site or at a later date, such as upon check-in at the relevant Haka Lodge location (“the Lodge”). Prices are subject to change without notice, and all persons are obliged to pay the overnight price current at the time of reservation.\n\n2. PAYMENT\nPayment of the full booking amount is due on check-in. This payment will be taken from the credit card registered to the booking unless otherwise organised.\n\nHaka Lodge is not responsible for currency conversion and therefore any questions regarding currency conversion must be directed to your credit card company.\n\nIf you have not arrived within one hour of reception closing, we reserve the right to charge the first night of your booking to the card registered to your booking.\n\n3. SURCHARGES\nA credit card surcharge of 2% for Visa and Mastercard will apply to all payments made.\n\n4. PRE-AUTHORISATION & DEPOSIT\nAll reservations must be guaranteed with a valid credit card at time of booking. A deposit is not required, except for bookings over $300, which will be charged the first night’s payment at time of booking. This is refundable for cancellations made 48 hours before arrival date. Agent and advance rate group bookings may also require a deposit. Please inquire directly.\n\nWe pre-authorise all credit cards on the day of booking to check for validity and sufficiency of funds. Please note this process validates the presented credit card, and protects both the cardholder and merchant from increasing fraud incidents. The pre-authorised amount of NZ$1 is set aside by the credit card company for a period of up to 10 days. The pre-authorisation will affect your available funds and/or spending limit. For more information on this practice we suggest the cardholder contact their card issuer. No money is taken from your credit card but it will show as a ‘Pending Transaction’ and you may choose to use a different payment type to pay your final bill.\n\n5. CANCELLATION POLICY\nThe Cancellation policy is the same for all properties.\n\nThe Flexible 1-day (24 hours) Cancellation Policy is the most standardised policy.\n\nFlexible Rates – 1-Day Cancellation:\n\nThe guest can cancel free of charge until one day (24 hours before 1400 NZT on the arrival day). After that, the guest will be charged the cost of the first night for each room/bed booked if they cancel within one day of arrival.\n\nFull payment is taken 1 day prior to the guest checking in.  Therefore, if cancellation occurs, a refund may need to be processed.\n\nNon-Refundable Rates:\n\nThe guest will be charged the total amount for their stay if they cancel a non-refundable booking at any time.\nFull payment is taken upon confirmation of the reservation.\n\nNo shows:\nNo refund for no shows, guests are liable for the full amount of the booking.\n\nCancellation exceptions: Grace period: No fees charged for bookings cancelled within 1 hour of making the booking.\n\n \n\nChanges: Any change to the arrival date, departure date or room type of this reservation is subject to the Lodge’s availability at the time the change is requested and may result in a possible rate change or an additional fee.\n\nNon-refundable bookings have no option to cancel or receive a refund at a later date. Bookings made via an online agent such as Booking.com, Expedia or Ctrip must be cancelled by the guest via this agent before Haka Lodge is able to formally cancel the booking.\n\nHaka Lodge will operate within the Consumer Guarantees Act & Fair Trading Act.\n\n6. OUR RIGHT TO CANCEL\nWe may cancel your reservation at any time with immediate effect by giving you written notice (which includes email) if you do not pay us when you are required to do so or you breach your contract with us in any other material way. If we cancel your reservation where you are at fault, we reserve our legal rights in respect of your breach of contract.\n\nWe may also cancel your reservation if an event outside of our control (including industrial action, acts of terrorism, explosion, earthquakes, fire, flooding, and failure of power and/or water supplies or emergency evacuation) means that we are unable to make your room available to you. In such event we will contact you to let you know as soon as possible and if you have already paid for your room, we will refund your payment to you, or if you have not yet paid for your room, you will not have to make any payment to us.\n\nSave as set out above, we will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by an event outside of our control. Such limitation of liability does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n7. GROUP BOOKINGS\nA reservation of four rooms or more is usually considered a group booking and cannot be made through our site. For group bookings please email reservations@hakalodge.com. We reserve the right to terminate a reservation of four or more rooms, either through a single transaction or multiple transactions, which we determine was made through our site in a fraudulent manner or in such a manner so as to avoid the group booking requirement.\n\n8. THIRD-PARTY BOOKINGS\nBookings made through a third-party website are subject to that site’s terms and conditions. Please be aware these may differ from ours.\n\n9. AGE LIMITS\nGuests must be a minimum of 18 years of age. Exceptions may be pre-authorised by the Lodge manager. We require valid identification on check-in in the form of a driver’s licence or passport.\n\n10. PETS\nAssistance dogs, such as guide dogs, hearing dogs, and dogs for those who are disabled, are permitted. Otherwise we uphold a strict no pets policy.\n\n11. MAXIMUM ROOM OCCUPANCY\nThe maximum number of guests per room type is clearly specified on our website and via all our online agent sites. Failure to book appropriate rooms/bed numbers for your group may result in members of your party being turned away and/or penalty charges.\n\n12. ELIGIBILITY\nGuests must be at least 18 years old in order to make a reservation or complete a purchase through our site or any other booking channel. In using this website and submitting credit card details you represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age to create a legal binding obligation for any liability incurred. For the avoidance of doubt, any persons aged 17 years or younger must be accompanied by a parent or guardian for the duration of their stay in one of our Lodges. All guests must provide valid identification in the form of a driver’s licence or passport at check-in.\n\n13. ROOM ALLOCATION\nWhile every endeavour will be made to ensure you are accommodated in the same room throughout your stay, due to limited availability at time of booking, it may be necessary for you to change rooms. If applicable, you will be advised of this at check-in. You will be accommodated in a room of similar or higher standard to that originally booked.\n\nDue to limited availability at time of booking, multi-share accommodation for two or more guests may be provided in separate rooms. Every endeavour will be made to ensure this does not occur, but should this be necessary you will be advised at check-in.\n\nAll bunk room beds are allocated on a first come, first served basis.\n\n \n\nPRIVACY OF INFORMATION – WEBSITE USE\nHaka Lodge recognises the privacy concerns of its customers, clients, guests, contacts and the users of its website. We store your details in our Property Management System as a profile, which in the future can be used for any other bookings. This will already have your preferences mentioned so we can cater all your needs.\n\n \n\nARRIVAL & DEPARTURE\n1. CHECK-IN\nCheck-in is from 14.00NZT.\n\nIf you arrive earlier on the date of your stay we are more than happy to hold your bags for you until your room/apartment is available.\n\nEarly check-in is subject to availability on the day of arrival.\n\nWe require valid identification on check-in in the form of driver’s licence or passport and evidence of your booking reference or voucher for bookings made via travel agents and online travel agent (OTA) websites.\n\nThe guest is not entitled to the provision of specific rooms unless the Lodge has confirmed this in writing.\n\n2. LATE ARRIVALS\nWe request that guests advise us of late arrival plans (arrival times after 20.00 NZT) prior to date of arrival. In these instances directions on how to obtain the room key will be informed by the Haka Lodge Reservations Team.\n\nEntrance into the Haka Lodge building will be treated as an acceptance to our terms and conditions.\n\n3. CHECK-OUT\nCheck-out time is 10.00 NZT. We request that guests fully vacate the bed/room/apartment by this time. Belongings cannot be stored in the apartment after this time, however we have secure storage available on request.\n\nLate check-out is subject to availability, must be pre-arranged and may incur additional charges.\n\nIf you wish to extend your stay please contact the team with as much notice as possible; extensions are subject to availability and may result in a room move. If you wish to shorten your stay this must be done with at least 24 hours’ notice of your new check-out date.\n\nAny delays in vacating room after 10.00 NZT will result in an additional delay fee on the top of the room rate.\n\n4. NON-GUEST VISITORS\nAll non-guest visitors must be met by a named guest and signed in at reception before accessing the building. The named guest is responsible for the visitor while onsite and liable for any damages, and room fees for that the visitor incurs.\n\nThere is a maximum of two non-guest visitors allowed access to the building per room/apartment unless otherwise pre-authorised with management.

    "operator_hours": "Hours:\n0900-1800",
    "terms_conditions": "1. RATES\nAll rates displayed are in New Zealand dollars and are inclusive of taxes.\n\nAll prices quoted are per person, per night, unless otherwise stated.\n\nDouble and Twin rooms sleep two people, but may be booked for one person only. In this circumstance, the room rate will apply.\n\nWe adopt dynamic pricing and the price of our rooms, products and services fluctuates based on demand and other factors. Before confirming a reservation or purchase, we will provide you with a total price for the requested number of rooms and nights, together with the charges for any additional products or services you may have added. Depending on the room rate selected, payment may be due at the time the reservation is made through our site or at a later date, such as upon check-in at the relevant Haka Lodge location (“the Lodge”). Prices are subject to change without notice, and all persons are obliged to pay the overnight price current at the time of reservation.\n\n2. PAYMENT\nPayment of the full booking amount is due on check-in. This payment will be taken from the credit card registered to the booking unless otherwise organised.\n\nHaka Lodge is not responsible for currency conversion and therefore any questions regarding currency conversion must be directed to your credit card company.\n\nIf you have not arrived within one hour of reception closing, we reserve the right to charge the first night of your booking to the card registered to your booking.\n\n3. SURCHARGES\nA credit card surcharge of 2% for Visa and Mastercard will apply to all payments made.\n\n4. PRE-AUTHORISATION & DEPOSIT\nAll reservations must be guaranteed with a valid credit card at time of booking. A deposit is not required, except for bookings over $300, which will be charged the first night’s payment at time of booking. This is refundable for cancellations made 48 hours before arrival date. Agent and advance rate group bookings may also require a deposit. Please inquire directly.\n\nWe pre-authorise all credit cards on the day of booking to check for validity and sufficiency of funds. Please note this process validates the presented credit card, and protects both the cardholder and merchant from increasing fraud incidents. The pre-authorised amount of NZ$1 is set aside by the credit card company for a period of up to 10 days. The pre-authorisation will affect your available funds and/or spending limit. For more information on this practice we suggest the cardholder contact their card issuer. No money is taken from your credit card but it will show as a ‘Pending Transaction’ and you may choose to use a different payment type to pay your final bill.\n\n5. CANCELLATION POLICY\nThe Cancellation policy is the same for all properties.\n\nThe Flexible 1-day (24 hours) Cancellation Policy is the most standardised policy.\n\nFlexible Rates – 1-Day Cancellation:\n\nThe guest can cancel free of charge until one day (24 hours before 1400 NZT on the arrival day). After that, the guest will be charged the cost of the first night for each room/bed booked if they cancel within one day of arrival.\n\nFull payment is taken 1 day prior to the guest checking in.  Therefore, if cancellation occurs, a refund may need to be processed.\n\nNon-Refundable Rates:\n\nThe guest will be charged the total amount for their stay if they cancel a non-refundable booking at any time.\nFull payment is taken upon confirmation of the reservation.\n\nNo shows:\nNo refund for no shows, guests are liable for the full amount of the booking.\n\nCancellation exceptions: Grace period: No fees charged for bookings cancelled within 1 hour of making the booking.\n\n \n\nChanges: Any change to the arrival date, departure date or room type of this reservation is subject to the Lodge’s availability at the time the change is requested and may result in a possible rate change or an additional fee.\n\nNon-refundable bookings have no option to cancel or receive a refund at a later date. Bookings made via an online agent such as Booking.com, Expedia or Ctrip must be cancelled by the guest via this agent before Haka Lodge is able to formally cancel the booking.\n\nHaka Lodge will operate within the Consumer Guarantees Act & Fair Trading Act.\n\n6. OUR RIGHT TO CANCEL\nWe may cancel your reservation at any time with immediate effect by giving you written notice (which includes email) if you do not pay us when you are required to do so or you breach your contract with us in any other material way. If we cancel your reservation where you are at fault, we reserve our legal rights in respect of your breach of contract.\n\nWe may also cancel your reservation if an event outside of our control (including industrial action, acts of terrorism, explosion, earthquakes, fire, flooding, and failure of power and/or water supplies or emergency evacuation) means that we are unable to make your room available to you. In such event we will contact you to let you know as soon as possible and if you have already paid for your room, we will refund your payment to you, or if you have not yet paid for your room, you will not have to make any payment to us.\n\nSave as set out above, we will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by an event outside of our control. Such limitation of liability does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n7. GROUP BOOKINGS\nA reservation of four rooms or more is usually considered a group booking and cannot be made through our site. For group bookings please email reservations@hakalodge.com. We reserve the right to terminate a reservation of four or more rooms, either through a single transaction or multiple transactions, which we determine was made through our site in a fraudulent manner or in such a manner so as to avoid the group booking requirement.\n\n8. THIRD-PARTY BOOKINGS\nBookings made through a third-party website are subject to that site’s terms and conditions. Please be aware these may differ from ours.\n\n9. AGE LIMITS\nGuests must be a minimum of 18 years of age. Exceptions may be pre-authorised by the Lodge manager.

MAXIMUM ROOM OCCUPANCY\nThe maximum number of guests per room type is clearly specified on our website and via all our online agent sites. Failure to book appropriate rooms/bed numbers for your group may result in members of your party being turned away and/or penalty charges.\n\n12. ELIGIBILITY\nGuests must be at least 18 years old in order to make a reservation or complete a purchase through our site or any other booking channel. In using this website and submitting credit card details you represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age to create a legal binding obligation for any liability incurred.

All guests must provide valid identification in the form of a driver’s licence or passport at check-in.\n\n13. ROOM ALLOCATION\nWhile every endeavour will be made to ensure you are accommodated in the same room throughout your stay, due to limited availability at time of booking, it may be necessary for you to change rooms. If applicable, you will be advised of this at check-in. You will be accommodated in a room of similar or higher standard to that originally booked.\n\nDue to limited availability at time of booking, multi-share accommodation for two or more guests may be provided in separate rooms. Every endeavour will be made to ensure this does not occur, but should this be necessary you will be advised at check-in.\n\nAll bunk room beds are allocated on a first come, first served basis.\n\n \n\nPRIVACY OF INFORMATION – WEBSITE USE\nHaka Lodge recognises the privacy concerns of its customers, clients, guests, contacts and the users of its website.

NON-GUEST VISITORS\nAll non-guest visitors must be met by a named guest and signed in at reception before accessing the building. The named guest is responsible for the visitor while onsite and liable for any damages, and room fees for that the visitor incurs.\n\nThere is a maximum of two non-guest visitors allowed access to the building per room/apartment unless otherwise pre-authorised with management. These visitors must be signed out by 20.00 NZT in compliance with our Fire and Egress process.\n\nIf Haka Lodge guests wish to add extra people to their room occupancy this must be pre-arranged with the front desk team and must not exceed the capacity of their room/apartment.\n\n \n\nYOUR STAY\n1. SMOKING\nSmoking is not permitted inside any part of Haka Lodge buildings; this includes the use of vapes. There are designated areas for smokers outside the building.

Any guest suspected of or caught altering smoke detectors or sprinklers will be asked to leave the property immediately without refund.\n\n2. FIRE ALARM CHARGES\nOur fire alarms are automatically connected to the fire service. If there is evidence to suggest that a heat or smoke sensor has been set off purposefully or through a guest’s active negligence, heavy use of aerosol products or smoking/vaping in the building the guest will be liable to pay the fire service call out charge (NZ$1200). Any guest suspected of or caught altering smoke detectors or sprinklers will be asked to leave the property immediately without refund.\n\n3.

    "description": "Small Pet Friendly Site at Foxton Beach\n\nWeary travellers driving around the south-western coast of North Island rest at… Traveller Rest, a small, family-friendly campground in the pretty resort of Foxton Beach. Level touring sites have both gravel (for your vehicle) and grass, so you can feel nature under your toes as you set up the barbecue or open a deckchair to relax with a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc in hand… Traveller Rest benefits from a pretty excellent location. Most things you are likely to need on a day-to-day basis can be found within a short drive (some within a short walk), starting with a supermarket (five minutes’ drive), continuing with dining establishments (there are two restaurants, a fish-and-chips takeaway and a café within a 15-minute walk) and ending with a sandy beach just over a kilometre away (a 15-minute walk). Don’t fancy lugging your gear all the way to the beach? Good news: the beach car park is a five-minute drive from the campground, and once there all you need to do is cross the vegetation-covered dunes and you’re on the surf. There is loads more to keep you entertained during your coastal break, including a large green area with a duck pond, a skate park and a pump track (five minutes’ walk) and forested mountain-bike trails (20 minutes by bike). Traveller Rest welcomes well-behaved dogs on leads, and sites here come with power and water connections. However, please note that there is no dump station, so a self-containment certificate is required.",

These units are perfect for couples, families, large or small groups. Tucked into a small quiet cul-de-sac just 40 metres metres from the water's edge it gives you the feeling of being away from it all but just minutes up to the city centre, movie houses and restaurants of Strand Street waterfront.

Your hosts are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and respectfully require proof of the same from guests under the government's vaccination mandate for the hospitality sector. Our experience is your unique assurance in selecting the best Bay of Islands accommodation. As owner operators for 25 years, we go out of our way to do everything we possibly can to give all guests the best experience of New Zealand hospitality, food and wine. Guest comments suggest we have achieved this during our time at Orongo Bay Homestead (booking.com guest satisfaction survey 2018 of 96%).\n\nSequestered in 1.5 private hectares, just five minutes drive from Waitangi Treaty Grounds, this riverfront lodge offers restorative peace and calm, organic-focused cuisine, and accommodation in two ensuite rooms with pastoral and river views. Food and travel writer Michael Hooper and partner Rev. Chris Wharehinga Swannell (of Maori ancestry) prepare a `bake-house breakfast` delivered to your room's own balcony or served at the kauri native timber dining suite, with home-baked breads and croissants, home-made conserves from the organic gardens and orchard, and eggs from free-range hens. Easy walks through the estate's native bush under soaring trees, skirt and overlook the Waitangi River with its ducks and other birdlife. A pre-ordered platter overlooking the river with a fine New Zealand wine is a soothing, casual alternative to the restaurant options of Paihia. Gourmet dinners with matched wine may be planned in advance for four or six resident guests. Close to all the activities on the waters of the Bay, to local wineries, and across the beaches of the bay of 144 islands, Riverside Homestead is without pretention but generously provisioned with modern comforts, respect for the privacy of guests and attention to detail. At least four hours notice is required to prepare your room. Higher Covid Alert levels may affect the services offered.",

    "description": "Kinloch Wilderness Retreat is a remote, lakeside wilderness lodge located just a stones throw from the Routeburn and Greenstone tracks. A peaceful location with amazing lake and mountain views, only 1hr from Queenstown via a stunning drive around the head of the lake. Since 1868 there has been hospitality offered at Kinloch, with our Heritage Lodge dating back to these times. Our restaurant offers delicious food made with local and organic ingredients and can accommodate all dietary requirements. Our guest kitchen is fully equipped if guests prefer to self-cater. Sustainability and care for our environment is key to operating in our location and we try to tread as lightly we can. Over the years we have created a vegetable garden, stopped takeaway cups, installed many solar panels and batteries, switched to EVs, moved to heatpumps to keep everyone cozy, we use local suppliers and contractors as much as possible, and so much more. We have e-bikes, e-motorbikes, and fishing rods for hire. The hot tub is always on and perfect at any time of day. In warmer months we offer guided kayak trips along the shoreline. When we have a yoga teacher on staff there are yoga classes in our yurt, nestled in the beech forest, and the space can be hired by guests for personal use. Our new (in 2025) Wai Area contains a large spa pool, infrared sauna, and ice shower for some wellness relaxation.\n\nWe offer a variety of accommodation ranging from 4-share bunkrooms, private double and family rooms, through to our Heritage Lodge rooms dating back to 1868. Wilderness rooms share central bathroom facilities, with 1 room ensuite, and the Heritage rooms share 2 bathrooms. In total we can sleep 57 (including our EcoScapes) and the site has hosted plenty of celebrations over the years. Facilities on site to enable guests to relax and enjoy their stay include a hot tub, book exchange, board games, a communal lounge and a TV room, perfect after an active day. Guests can self-cater or enjoy a meal in our restaurant full of boutique beers, award winning wine, with food from breakfast through to dinner, plus happy hour daily. All dietary requirements can be catered for and we have a kids menu for those under 12.\n\nLocal activities include hiking (there are many more than the Routeburn), kayaking, fishing, jetboating, horse-trekking, ziplining, flying or simply enjoying the magnificent natural surroundings. On site there are e-bikes, e-motorbikes, and fishing rods for hire. In warmer months we offer guided kayak trips along the shoreline.

Cosy up by the fireplace after a day’s walking in the winds of a wild west winter, or turn on the heat pump for instant heat.\n\nThe flat has four single beds, a heater and a shower and toilet a couple of steps from the sliding doors.\n\nAll beds have comfortable mattresses, pillows and blankets. PLEASE BRING YOUR OWN bed linen, towels, tea towels, toiletries, toilet paper and rubbish bags to TAKE HOME YOUR RUBBISH.\n\nPlease leave everything clean and tidy – as you would like to find it.

    "description": "Right in the middle of Mt Hutt Village you’ll find The Blue Pub Methven, and you can’t miss it, because it’s, well…blue. Perfectly situated a short drive from no less than six different ski fields and the famous Mt Hutt Ski Area is but a snowball’s throw away. A truly gorgeous building with sweeping verandahs, and inside you’ll find a warm welcome, cold beer, excellent wine, delicious food and relaxing, comfortable accommodation perfect after a day of adventure in this awesome part of the country. Whether you choose the Blue Restaurant for a meal in front of the fire or catch up with our crew in the main bar and munch through the famous Blue Burger on the verandah in the sun….you will have made the right choice either way. The Blue likes to think that it’s one of Canterbury’s major live venues for music and many renowned artists have played here! Whether it’s a band in the Main Bar or a bigger touring band rocking it in Samuels Summit Bar… it’s always a great night. And if you stay a bit too late and feel a little “well done” our rooms upstairs are there for the taking. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to party with your mates in the famous Blue Pub Bar or enjoy a superb meal at the Blue Restaurant, and then simply walk up the stairs to your room? Well you can! The Blue Pub Methven has budget accommodation available in true authentic kiwi pub style, ideal for skiers, backpackers and budget travellers. The rooms are warm, clean and comfortable with singles, twins and super king beds. We also have one triple and one quad room to cater for larger budget groups. There is a small shared TV lounge (Sky TV downstairs in the Main Bar). The shared kitchenette has a small fridge, microwave, toaster and jug for guest use. Our shared bathroom facilities include 4 showers and 4 toilets. None of our rooms are ensuited. High speed Wi-Fi internet is available throughout the hotel and is complimentary when you stay with us. Also on offer is off street parking and best of all, you only need to walk across the road to catch your transport if you are heading up to Mt Hutt for a day of skiing or snowboarding. The Blue’s central location also means you are only a few minutes walk from Methven’s array of shops, cafes, movie theatre, restaurants, bike park or whatever else you fancy. If we are full on the night(s) you are looking for, why not check out our friends at The Brown Pub – just across the road with warm comfortable upstairs accommodation and great prices.",

    "description": "For a rural retreat in Kaikoura NZ, try Dylans rustic cottage B&B. Dylans Country Cottages is two unique rustic b&b cottages, Mahoe and Kowhai. They are in a rural setting beneath the spectacular Seaward Kaikoura mountain range. Dylans is only five minutes from central Kaikoura, 2.5 hours drive from Christchurch, and 2 hours drive from the Picton ferries. Each cottage has an upstairs mezzanine bedroom with beds made from Macrocarpa grown on the property. The French doors in the lounge open onto the garden, which gives New Zealand’s famed indoor-outdoor flow. The kitchenette area is small and basic but more than adequate to make breakfast and simple meals. You can order a packed lunch or evening meal. These need to be ordered 24 hours in advance, however. The lavender and flower gardens of Lavendyl surround the cottages. These are separate from Dylans; guests are free to wander in them at their leisure. The gardens are open to the public during the day. There is an on-site gift shop that stocks quality lavender products and other gift items. You can also order these online.\n\nDaily Seasonal Breakfast We provide a homemade continental breakfast for you to enjoy in the comfort of your cottage. A typical breakfast will have orange juice, muesli, yogurt, eggs from our chickens, and freshly baked bread. The eggs are fresh for you to cook as you wish. We pride ourselves on the bread selection we offer, from Scottish morning rolls to French baguettes, croissants, and Brioche made from scratch on-site.

RATES\nAll rates displayed are in New Zealand dollars and are inclusive of taxes.\n\nAll prices quoted are per person, per night, unless otherwise stated.\n\nDouble and Twin rooms sleep two people, but may be booked for one person only. In this circumstance, the room rate will apply.\n\nWe adopt dynamic pricing and the price of our rooms, products and services fluctuates based on demand and other factors. Before confirming a reservation or purchase, we will provide you with a total price for the requested number of rooms and nights, together with the charges for any additional products or services you may have added. Depending on the room rate selected, payment may be due at the time the reservation is made through our site or at a later date, such as upon check-in at the relevant Haka Lodge location (“the Lodge”). Prices are subject to change without notice, and all persons are obliged to pay the overnight price current at the time of reservation.\n\n2. PAYMENT\nPayment of the full booking amount is due on check-in. This payment will be taken from the credit card registered to the booking unless otherwise organised.\n\nHaka Lodge is not responsible for currency conversion and therefore any questions regarding currency conversion must be directed to your credit card company.\n\nIf you have not arrived within one hour of reception closing, we reserve the right to charge the first night of your booking to the card registered to your booking.\n\n3. SURCHARGES\nA credit card surcharge of 2% for Visa and Mastercard will apply to all payments made.\n\n4. PRE-AUTHORISATION & DEPOSIT\nAll reservations must be guaranteed with a valid credit card at time of booking. A deposit is not required, except for bookings over $300, which will be charged the first night’s payment at time of booking. This is refundable for cancellations made 48 hours before arrival date. Agent and advance rate group bookings may also require a deposit. Please inquire directly.\n\nWe pre-authorise all credit cards on the day of booking to check for validity and sufficiency of funds. Please note this process validates the presented credit card, and protects both the cardholder and merchant from increasing fraud incidents. The pre-authorised amount of NZ$1 is set aside by the credit card company for a period of up to 10 days. The pre-authorisation will affect your available funds and/or spending limit. For more information on this practice we suggest the cardholder contact their card issuer. No money is taken from your credit card but it will show as a ‘Pending Transaction’ and you may choose to use a different payment type to pay your final bill.\n\n5. CANCELLATION POLICY\nThe Cancellation policy is the same for all properties.\n\nThe Flexible 1-day (24 hours) Cancellation Policy is the most standardised policy.\n\nFlexible Rates – 1-Day Cancellation:\n\nThe guest can cancel free of charge until one day (24 hours before 1400 NZT on the arrival day). After that, the guest will be charged the cost of the first night for each room/bed booked if they cancel within one day of arrival.\n\nFull payment is taken 1 day prior to the guest checking in.  Therefore, if cancellation occurs, a refund may need to be processed.\n\nNon-Refundable Rates:\n\nThe guest will be charged the total amount for their stay if they cancel a non-refundable booking at any time.\nFull payment is taken upon confirmation of the reservation.\n\nNo shows:\nNo refund for no shows, guests are liable for the full amount of the booking.\n\nCancellation exceptions: Grace period: No fees charged for bookings cancelled within 1 hour of making the booking.\n\n \n\nChanges: Any change to the arrival date, departure date or room type of this reservation is subject to the Lodge’s availability at the time the change is requested and may result in a possible rate change or an additional fee.\n\nNon-refundable bookings have no option to cancel or receive a refund at a later date. Bookings made via an online agent such as Booking.com, Expedia or Ctrip must be cancelled by the guest via this agent before Haka Lodge is able to formally cancel the booking.\n\nHaka Lodge will operate within the Consumer Guarantees Act & Fair Trading Act.\n\n6. OUR RIGHT TO CANCEL\nWe may cancel your reservation at any time with immediate effect by giving you written notice (which includes email) if you do not pay us when you are required to do so or you breach your contract with us in any other material way. If we cancel your reservation where you are at fault, we reserve our legal rights in respect of your breach of contract.\n\nWe may also cancel your reservation if an event outside of our control (including industrial action, acts of terrorism, explosion, earthquakes, fire, flooding, and failure of power and/or water supplies or emergency evacuation) means that we are unable to make your room available to you. In such event we will contact you to let you know as soon as possible and if you have already paid for your room, we will refund your payment to you, or if you have not yet paid for your room, you will not have to make any payment to us.\n\nSave as set out above, we will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by an event outside of our control.

In this circumstance, the room rate will apply.\n\nWe adopt dynamic pricing and the price of our rooms, products and services fluctuates based on demand and other factors. Before confirming a reservation or purchase, we will provide you with a total price for the requested number of rooms and nights, together with the charges for any additional products or services you may have added. Depending on the room rate selected, payment may be due at the time the reservation is made through our site or at a later date, such as upon check-in at the relevant Haka Lodge location (“the Lodge”). Prices are subject to change without notice, and all persons are obliged to pay the overnight price current at the time of reservation.\n\n2. PAYMENT\nPayment of the full booking amount is due on check-in. This payment will be taken from the credit card registered to the booking unless otherwise organised.\n\nHaka Lodge is not responsible for currency conversion and therefore any questions regarding currency conversion must be directed to your credit card company.\n\nIf you have not arrived within one hour of reception closing, we reserve the right to charge the first night of your booking to the card registered to your booking.\n\n3. SURCHARGES\nA credit card surcharge of 2% for Visa and Mastercard will apply to all payments made.\n\n4. PRE-AUTHORISATION & DEPOSIT\nAll reservations must be guaranteed with a valid credit card at time of booking.

Agent and advance rate group bookings may also require a deposit. Please inquire directly.\n\nWe pre-authorise all credit cards on the day of booking to check for validity and sufficiency of funds. Please note this process validates the presented credit card, and protects both the cardholder and merchant from increasing fraud incidents. The pre-authorised amount of NZ$1 is set aside by the credit card company for a period of up to 10 days. The pre-authorisation will affect your available funds and/or spending limit. For more information on this practice we suggest the cardholder contact their card issuer. No money is taken from your credit card but it will show as a ‘Pending Transaction’ and you may choose to use a different payment type to pay your final bill.\n\n5. CANCELLATION POLICY\nThe Cancellation policy is the same for all properties.\n\nThe Flexible 1-day (24 hours) Cancellation Policy is the most standardised policy.\n\nFlexible Rates – 1-Day Cancellation:\n\nThe guest can cancel free of charge until one day (24 hours before 1400 NZT on the arrival day). After that, the guest will be charged the cost of the first night for each room/bed booked if they cancel within one day of arrival.\n\nFull payment is taken 1 day prior to the guest checking in.  Therefore, if cancellation occurs, a refund may need to be processed.\n\nNon-Refundable Rates:\n\nThe guest will be charged the total amount for their stay if they cancel a non-refundable booking at any time.\nFull payment is taken upon confirmation of the reservation.\n\nNo shows:\nNo refund for no shows, guests are liable for the full amount of the booking.\n\nCancellation exceptions: Grace period: No fees charged for bookings cancelled within 1 hour of making the booking.\n\n \n\nChanges: Any change to the arrival date, departure date or room type of this reservation is subject to the Lodge’s availability at the time the change is requested and may result in a possible rate change or an additional fee.\n\nNon-refundable bookings have no option to cancel or receive a refund at a later date. Bookings made via an online agent such as Booking.com, Expedia or Ctrip must be cancelled by the guest via this agent before Haka Lodge is able to formally cancel the booking.\n\nHaka Lodge will operate within the Consumer Guarantees Act & Fair Trading Act.\n\n6. OUR RIGHT TO CANCEL\nWe may cancel your reservation at any time with immediate effect by giving you written notice (which includes email) if you do not pay us when you are required to do so or you breach your contract with us in any other material way. If we cancel your reservation where you are at fault, we reserve our legal rights in respect of your breach of contract.\n\nWe may also cancel your reservation if an event outside of our control (including industrial action, acts of terrorism, explosion, earthquakes, fire, flooding, and failure of power and/or water supplies or emergency evacuation) means that we are unable to make your room available to you. In such event we will contact you to let you know as soon as possible and if you have already paid for your room, we will refund your payment to you, or if you have not yet paid for your room, you will not have to make any payment to us.\n\nSave as set out above, we will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by an event outside of our control.

    "description": "Pinewood is ideally located in a beautiful alpine setting away from the hustle and bustle of busy streets and yet only 7 minutes walk from the centre of Queenstown. A village of houses big, small, shared and solo, Pinewood Lodge is your home away from home. Nestled into the mountain side, surrounded by stunning vistas, grand pines and open grassy areas, it's your hideaway just seven-minutes' walk from the hustle and bustle. All of the houses and units have their own lounge, kitchen and bathroom, providing you with everything you need to put your feet up, have a dinner in or brew yourself a cuppa. Our staff love Queenstown as much as you do and have plenty of local tips and tricks to help you make the most of your visit. If you're short on mates, our social areas, friendly staff and like-minded guests make it the perfect place to meet new people. If you're here to relax or just not really a people-person, our private rooms and homes provide the seclusion you so desire. There's truly room for everyone at Pinewood Lodge. FACILITIES WE OFFER RECEPTION: As well as being super friendly - but not so much that it's kind of annoying - our reception is a full booking agency. Helpful staff with local tips and tricks, we'll give you all the advice you need to have a local experience. We also offer discounts on some activities, so it's always worth checking in before you check out Queenstown. INTERNET: We recommend spending as much time away from your phone and computer as possible, but when you need the internet we've got you covered. Internet facilities in our reception include email, web surfing, printing, and wireless internet access. Wireless internet is available throughout the property. LAUNDRY: Being the adventure capital of New Zealand, we thought we should probably have two laundries. They are both open twenty-four hours and contain automatic washing machines, dryers and irons. Powder and change available at reception. BAG & GEAR STORAGE: We've got safe storage space for all your gear and valuables, including ski storage outside most units, bike storage by The Hub, bag storage at reception and a safe for those extra precious items. Identification tags available on request. BBQ:There's nothing like standing around a burning grill with a cold stubby in hand and a good mate by your side. In fact, some would say it's a New Zealand rite of passage. We've got a shared 'barbie' area for groups - that's BBQ in Kiwi. SPA: After a long day on the bike, slopes or trails, you'll have earned yourself a soak in our spa. With wondrous views of the Remarkables, it's a sight for sore eyes and sorer bodies. Open from 12pm to 8pm, NZ$10 for thirty minutes. Book with the friendly folks at reception. LINEN: All private rooms include bed linen and towels. Dorms include bed linen only, but towels can be hired from reception if you're one of those 'travel light' folks. OFF-STREET PARKING: You'll be happy to know",

    "description": "Ruakaka Beach Holiday Park is situated on 13.8 hectares of reserve land owned by the Department of Conservation. It is surrounded by a tidal estuary that leads out to the sea, this area is home to a variety of bird species. The holiday park has a rich history dating back to the 1930s. The Department of Conservation has established the Ruakaka Reserve Board to act as the guardian of the reserve land, and actively involves campers and the community in its planning, and encourages their input for the future. We provide various holiday accommodation options including basic cabins, water view cabins, non-powered sites, powered sites, and water view sites, ensuring everyone can stay. Tents, caravans, and campervans are welcome on all site choices. As a not-for-profit organization, the main source of funding for the holiday park comes from campground fees. These fees are reinvested into the park for upgrades and future development, this is based on the feedback received from our campers. We welcome our campers (manuhiri) with respect and kindness to make them feel welcome (manaakitanga). ` We are always working closely on sustainability, exploring different ways to improve our environmental impact”. We embrace our role as the kaitiaki of this beautiful reserve. We aim to create a place where generations of families can enjoy fun in the future. We take pride in believing that we are the best family camp in the north. We foster a positive work environment for our staff, helping them to be proud of who we are and where we work.` The Tiaki promise - to care for the people, the place and the culture\n\nOur camp is situated on the Ruakaka estuary entering the sea. It is very clean, friendly and family orientated in park-like grounds, situated on 13ha of peninsular. It’s one of the largest camp sites in New Zealand with 264 power sites, 80 non-powered sites and 9 backpacker cabins. A number of sites offer stunning views of the estuary and sea views, some with the water right at the edge of your site. We are halfway between Auckland and the Bay of Islands (134 km north of Auckland and 32km south east of Whangarei). The perfect place to stop as we are only seconds from SH1. Safe estuary for swimming and kayaking with a surf beach within short walking distance. The surf beach is patrolled over the summer period.

The beds are all high quality, comfortable, hotel standard beds, with hotel quality linen. A combination of the silence of the area and the comfort of the beds, ensures a stress-free peaceful night's sleep. For guests traveling with friends or family, the sitting rooms in two of the apartments (Tui and Bellbird) have bench type beds, and/or roll-away beds. These allow for 2 additional guests in each of these apartments.\n\nKereru Cottage is our new luxury offering. It stands on its own private part of the property, with undisturbed views over the ocean. It featues a large private deck and glass balustrade. The Lodge at Te Rawa offers guests the option to self-cater, or dine in our relaxed bar/restaurant. We also have a coffee shop with a full espresso machine for the added luxury of fresh coffee in the mornings. Accessible only by boat, the lodge is completely off the grid and a haven of peace. Our nearest neighbours live on a farm about 10 minutes' walk away and the farm has been in their family for six generations. We can help arrange farm tours for those interested in seeing the original homestead and the daily life of a large working sheep farm. Situated in the middle of the Pelorus sounds this is the perfect location for fishing, boating, walking, or just relaxing on the deck or the wharf with a glass of your favourite sundowner. We also have an extensive library of books which guests are free to borrow or buy. The Pelorus Sounds Mailboat stops here and a one-way trip from Havelock to Te Rawa is $50. It is a good idea to check their schedule as their timetable changes depending on the season.

    "description": "There are very few places in the world that can boast of such natural wonders as those offered by land and sea in the seaside settlement of Kaikoura. Situated midway between Christchurch and Picton on the rugged east coast of New Zealand's South Island, Kaikoura is overlooked by the majestic Southern Alps and offers a host of incredible activities, including whale-watching, swimming with seals and dolphins, albatross encounters, walks,&#160;golf, surfing, cycling and much more. A hidden jewel tucked between the towering Southern Alps and the aquamarine waters of the Pacific Ocean, The Factory is a luxuriously-converted historic building on the beachfront just north of the town. The Factory luxury accommodation is in a separate guest wing and is available to only one exclusive party of up to six guests. It has three king bedrooms and is fitted out with a full stainless-steel kitchen, open-plan lounge and dining area, as well as a private courtyard with outside spa and barbecue. The decor is probably best described as ‘industrial chic’: bespoke stainless steel furniture with industrial fittings balanced with velvet fabrics, white linen and crystal chandeliers. Quirky additions such as the stone door handles, original sliding barn doors, crystal bowls and original art works are delightful discoveries that add to a stay here. With underfloor heating and a log fire, The Factory is a truly indulgent place for couples, families or small groups of friends to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings all year round while availing themselves of all the unique experiences that Kaikoura has to offer.\n\nThe Factory was originally the Hapuku Co-operative Dairy Company and was constructed by a group of Hapuku and Kincaid farmers>br>Finding the distance to Kaikoura by horse and dray too great, they decided to open their own dairy company It opened on December 1st 1910 but closed on 28th March 1926 after motor transport made it redundantIt was then used as a woolshed for the next 70 years until two Auckland artists discovered it in a neglected state in 1996 They took on the mammoth task of converting the old building into a luxury 5-bedroom home They created a remarkable building of contrasts between the industrial rawness of concrete, steel and recycled timbers with the luxuriousness of indulgent fabrics and colours This theme has been continued by the present owners who opened up the guest wing as luxury accommodation in 2010\n\nJanet and Paul Boocock were both born in New Zealand but spent 30 years living on Scotland Island in Sydney, Australia before they fell in love with The Factory and returned to New Zealand in 2010\n\nPaul worked as a cameraman for 60 Minutes Australia for 28 years, travelling around the globe filming everything from war zones to interviews with the rich and famous Janet was an Assistant Principal at Newport Public School on Sydney’s Northern Beaches and together they owned and managed Pitt Point Cottage on Scotland Island, a popular weekend getaway\n\nWhile travelling around New Zealand with their two daughters, Hannah and Lucy, they discovered The Factory and realised they had found paradise Having renovated the guest wing, they opened in January 2011 Paul is a trained barista and now spends his time taking photos of this extraordinarily beautiful country and Janet has a diploma in proofreading and editing\n\nSince 2010 The Factory has had incredible feedback as to its stunning location and unique style Many guests have made multiple return visits with some guests flying to New Zealand just to stay at The Factory and all reviews have been positive and glowing.",

Lots of bird life with a small stream running along the boundary, home to many eels and native Kokopu. You'll never know you're in the city. Pets are welcome, there is even a large dog park across the stream suitable for walking dogs. We are only a 30 min walk into the city centre along the beautiful Waikato river path. WIFI is available but you will need to use this close to the house as it does not reach to the grass camping area. Directions: We are the last house on the left on McNicol Street. IMPORTANT NOTE (Please read BEFORE parking): During Winter months or if there has been a lot of rain please park up the main driveway as the grass area may be too boggy and we wouldn’t want you to get stuck (its happened to others)! The WIFI signal works well in the driveway and you will still have privacy surrounded by trees and bird life. There is a turning bay up the driveway but if you are in a large campervan please either call us first or come up to check that there is enough space to turn around (we may need to move one of our cars to make turning around easier). When the ground is firm (usually during summer months) you are welcome to park on the grass area but please always check with us first. There is a second gate with a `private` sign on it next to our main driveway. Please drive in, keeping to the left (away from the stream), where the ground is firmer and park on the grass. If you are in a larger campervan please turn around on the road and reverse in, keeping to the left away from the stream, and avoid trying to turn around on the grass. If you are at all unsure please come and see us first - just knock on the door if you don't see us around (even if its later in the evening - we don't mind!). Thanks, Taki & Simone NOTE: This is parking for self contained caravans & motorhomes only. Limit of ONE vehicle. Bookings essential.",
